# üßÆ AleksHaxx üíª
**üöß THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE FOR A WHILE üöß**

I have a genuine hatred towards the ALEKS software, and because my school  
district forces us to use this godforsaken software, and I'm lazy as hell,  
I poured hours of my life into this project just to not do aleks.

I think at this point i've spent more time cheating than if I actually did  
the work, but then again, others won't have to spend as long.

## üíª How It Works

### Quick Notes (so you get the hang of it)
*Question = the actual question, example: "solve this equation"*  
*Problem = the actual equation, example: `(2*2)+12/1`*  

*My system CANNOT understand mathematical notation, to manually convert to usable format,  
please use [THIS](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/mathtext.htm) dictionary to help you*

### Clients
* Screenshot Clients [In Development]:
  * Chromeium Extension (Chrome, Brave, basically any [chromium based browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium))
  * Firefox Extension
 
* Discord Clients [In Development, Usable Version Here]:
  * Integrated into [Clumsy](https://pieboi.xyz/kappy/)
  * You can make your own discord bot for it [here](discordbot/how2make.md) [Coming Soon...] 
    * *all-in-one self-hosted discord bot that does this*
    * **IT HAS NO IMAGE RECOGNITION** *im too lazy to add it*
    * **EVERYTHING IS SELF-HOSTED** *don't blow up your PC!*
    * *Yes it's technically skidding but idc.*

* Text Clients [None Exist]:
  * AleksHaxx Website *(soon...) will include image recognition later*
  * Instagram DMs Bot *(soon...)*
  * Snapchat Bot *(soon...) with Image Recognition!*

### Actual Steps
1. You screenshot or type out the question and the problem.
2. Hit enter on the client and wait for it to do its thing (5-30s)
3. It will solve the problem and give you the answer.
4. Type the answer in.

## üìã Reasons for making
1. Schools shouldn't pay these insane prices for awful software ~$29k for 800 students PER YEAR.
2. School Districts should not assign this as assessment grades, ON TOP OF HOMEWORK.
3. Teachers who lack the nessecasry skills to teach should not rely on this software.
4. Teachers should focus on helping students, not giving mundane tasks.

I have more reasons but to keep this brief and PG-13, this is all.

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Legality
* TECHNICALLY, this level of cheating IS NOT ILLEGAL.
* Pretty sure it's not against ALEKS' ToS.
  * *and even if it is I really do not care.*
* Although it is technically rule-breaking, there is no legal ground.
* In a court, it doesn't matter if it's moral, only if it's legal. ü§∑
  
To any ALEKS legal staff, please remember that I do not care and will NOT  
respond to any cease & dessist letters, GFY.

## ‚ùå In case of Project being Removed
In the unfortunate event that this project of mine is removed from github  
or down by ALEKS staff. And yes I will try to fight it because nobody  
decides when I'm done.

1. You can find it on [Internet Archive (unavailable)](https://web.archive.org/)
